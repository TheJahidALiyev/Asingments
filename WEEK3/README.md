In the first assigment:
Firstly, the program takes the elements of two arrays and by using "temp", it interchanges the elements with each other according to their place. Note: Any operation on an array has to be carried out element by element.In Program, we define a function Swap which carries out the process. For changing the values of variables, it has to be passed on to the function by pointers and not by values. This is because when the variable is passed on by value, only copy of the variable value is passed on to the function. The function may change the value of the copy but the original value of the variable remains unchanged. Program provides an illustration of this concept. 


In the second assignment:
Actually, the swap function that i wrote doesnt swap strings. it just changes local pointer variable and the changes are not reflected outsidethe function. Again by using "temp', it interchanges the contents of two strings.
